# Control-System-Design-Project
Project focuses on designing a control system that meets specific performance criteria. The system is analyzed using different controllers (P, I, and PI), and MATLAB simulations are conducted to verify the results. Additionally, a hardware implementation is proposed considering real-world constraints.
# MATLAB Simulations
The control system was analyzed in MATLAB-SIMULINK using:
Proportional (P) Controller
Integral (I) Controller
Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller
The PI controller was found to meet the performance criteria best.

# Hardware Implementation

A PI controller was designed using operational amplifiers, resistors, and capacitors, considering real-world constraints. The circuit was optimized for feasibility and cost-effectiveness.

# Result
The analysis conducted in the MATLAB-SIMULINK environment confirmed that the PI controller meets the desired specifications. A realistic hardware design was implemented to test the feasibility of the control system in a physical application.
The PI controller successfully met the desired specifications in MATLAB-SIMULINK analysis.
A realistic hardware implementation was designed and evaluated.
The system was optimized for stability and transient response.
